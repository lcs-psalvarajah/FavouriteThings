It took many years for me to develop a taste and the courage to eat unfamiliar types of food ")

So most of the times I had to try whatever was offered to me. But suprsingly the food was delicious, and made me fall in love with eating. I tried things that nobody in my family would believe I would eat. For example in this picture I ate cow tounge and stomach for the first time. And it taste so yummy. There was another time where I had to eat raw squid and honestly it tasted really good too.")
